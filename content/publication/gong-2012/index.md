abstract: "In-game actions of real-time strategy (RTS) games are extremely useful in determining the players' strategies, analyzing their behaviors and recommending ways to improve their play skills. Unfortunately, unstructured sequences of in-game actions are hardly informative enough for these analyses. The inconsistency we observed in human annotation of in-game data makes the analytical task even more challenging. In this paper, we propose an integrated system for in-game action segmentation and semantic label assignment based on a Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) model with essential features extracted from the in-game actions. Our experiments demonstrate that the accuracy of our solution can be as high as 98.9%."
