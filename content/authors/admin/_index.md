I am a senior research scientist at Living Analytics Research Centre (LARC), Singapore Management University. 

My current projects involve the development of: (1) personalized healthy eating and behavioral change technology for just-in-time interventions; and (2) a large-scale food knowledge crowdsourcing platform. My research interests include applications of data mining and machine learning techniques in computational social science, crowdsourcing, digital health, and personal informatics.

I was born and grew up in Thailand. Most of the time, people call me by my nickname __Aek__ (as in _egg_ :speaker: [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=th&tl=en&text=%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81)). My first name and last name are pronounced as follows: 

* __Palakorn__ as in _Pa-la-gon_ :speaker: [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=th&tl=en&text=%E0%B8%9E%E0%B8%A5%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3)
* __Achananuparp__ as in _A-cha-na-nu-pap_ :speaker: [Google Translate](https://translate.google.com/#view=home&op=translate&sl=th&tl=en&text=%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B8%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%9E)
